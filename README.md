# midi_messages_parser
This is a simple command line MIDI messages parser. It contains a simple code that you can run using Python and loops to ask you for the MIDI messages byte by byte and then it prints your MIDI messages displaying a table with three different representation of the MIDI message: binary, hexadecimal and decimal.

Do not forget to install the requirements.txt.
I am using the rich library available here: https://github.com/Textualize/rich to add some styaling to the console text.
